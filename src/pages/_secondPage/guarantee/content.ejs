          <h4>The Happyeasygo.com Best Price Guarantee applies to every Airline Ticket Reservation sold on Happyeasygo.com!</h4>
          <p class="grayDark">
            The lower price, including taxes and fees, must be available to the general public for booking on a website in the same currency in India, using the same form of payment and from the same point of sale as your original reservation at the same time (valid for 5 minutes) when you contact us. The lower price must be an exact match to the itinerary booked on Happyeasygo.com, including offering a same cancellation policy and fare rule. For reservations that are not pre-paid, we will either help you cancel your reservation so you can rebook at the lower price, or we will refund 200% of the difference after travel is completed.
